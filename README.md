## How to Run the App
### Prerequisites
Before running the app, we recommend the following:
1. Our app is built using **Python 3.12.8**, so other Python versions may cause compatibility issues with required packages.
2. Create a **separate virtual environment** and activate it. This helps manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.
3. Download ffmpeg from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html and path of executable file in your environment variables to avoid any failure while using speech to text/ emotion.

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TavishiS/Emotion2Movies.git
   ```
2. Enter the "Project" directory:
   ```sh
   cd Emotion2Movies/Project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## How We Deploy on AWS
1. Create an **AWS EC2 instance**.
2. Clone this repository in the home directory:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TavishiS/Emotion2Movies.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the "Project" directory:
   ```sh
   cd Emotion2Movies/Project
   ```
4. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv env
   ```
5. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
6. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
7. Test by running:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
   (Ensure all requirements are satisfied before proceeding.)
8. Start the app using Gunicorn:
   ```sh
   nohup gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:5000 -w 4 -k gevent app:app >/dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```
   - `-w 4` sets the number of workers.
   - `-k gevent` optimizes request handling.
9. The website will be available at: [http://public_ip_of_aws_instance:5000/](http://65.0.176.225:5000/)
   *(Note: The website will only be live when we start it from our side.)*
10. To check running processes:
    ```sh
    top -U <specific_user>
    ```
11. To stop Gunicorn:
    ```sh
    pkill gunicorn
    ```

## Why Use Gunicorn with nohup?
- **nohup**: Keeps the process running even after logging out, useful for remote servers via SSH.
- **-b**: Binds the application to all allowed IPs.
- **-w**: Defines the number of workers for handling multiple requests.
- **-k gevent**: Sets worker type to "gevent", which efficiently handles hundreds of requests per worker.
- **>/dev/null 2>&1 &**: Suppresses logs and runs the process in the background.
